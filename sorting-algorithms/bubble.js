/*
Bubble SORT

*** Description

Iterate over array, comparing adjacent items and swap if in incorrect order. Largest elements bubble to the end of the array

*** Exercises

- Implement bubble sort
- Identify time complexity

Optimizations:
- Make algorithm adaptive (if at any point array is already sorted, exit function early). After doing this, what is time complexity for nearly sorted arrays?
- For each pass through the array, are you doing any unnecessary checking of elements? Minimize checking and consider the effect on time complexity.

Variants:
- Implement cocktail sort (for each pass find both min and max values and sort in both directions). How does this impact performance?

function bubbleSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
      let temp;
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        temp = arr[j];
        arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
        arr[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}

// Time complexity: O(n^2)
